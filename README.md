# eda_practice
This repo will serve as practice for Exploratory Data Analyses.

The main objectives from this practice are:
    - To practice EDA using both SQL and Python to explore and gain insights from public datasets.
    - Develop my own blueprint of the things I want to check when doing EDA on a new dataset.
    - Practice asking interesting, consecuential business questions and answering them.
